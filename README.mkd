# Simplest ThinkPad Fan Throttler

I've been fed up with the fact that on my X220, once the fan goes above 3k RPM, it never slows down... even if the reported temperature drops below 40Â°C (which is roughly the point at which the fan will _only_ _engage_ after boot...). Contrary to other [currently](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Thinkpad_Fan_Control) available solutions, this one is arguably the simplest.

Configuration is done via defines, hopefully clear enough:

```
#define SENSOR    "/sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone0/temp" // where to read temperature from
#define FAN       "/proc/acpi/ibm/fan" // where to write control strings
#define LEVEL_LOW "level 1"     // the 'low level' control string
#define LEVEL_HI  "level auto"  // the 'high level' control string
#define THRESHOLD 47000 // threshold between low and high (unit as returned by SENSOR)
#define GRACE     16    // how many consecutive below threshold readouts before moving to high
#define DELAY     2     // pause between sensor reads, in seconds
```

I recommend to first ```make debug``` version and see if everything is as expected. Tweak the above as needed and when satisfied ```make all``` to get a silent version.
